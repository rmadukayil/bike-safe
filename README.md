# Bike Safe

## Rationale
This is a MERN stack application that allows users to visualize bike friendly areas and bike lanes in Toronto. Users can also take a look at bike accident locations, and areas where bikes have been reported stolen. 

This is a work in progress!

## Stack
# Front-end
* React.js
* React-google-maps
* Recharts

# Back-end
* Node.js
* Express
* Mongoose

# Database
* MongoDB

## Demo 
Here are some "action shots". Will update as I make more progress.
